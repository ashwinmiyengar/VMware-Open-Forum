# VMware-Open-Guide

A lot of information on VMware is already written. Most people learn it by reading a blog or the “[Pubs](https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/)”. Nonetheless, trustworthy and practical information and recommendations aren’t easy to come by. VMware's own documentation is a great but sprawling resource few have time to read fully, and it doesn’t include anything but official facts, so omits experiences of engineers. The information in blogs or othe recsources might also not consistently up to date.
This guide is by and for engineers who use VMware. It aims to be a useful, living reference that consolidates links, tips, gotchas, and best practices.


Scope
-----

-	Currently, this guide covers selected “core” products, such as vSphere, vCenter Server, vRealize Automation, NSX and partial details and tips around other products. We expect it to expand.
-	It is not a tutorial, but rather a collection of information you can read and return to. It is for both beginners and the experienced.
-	The goal of this guide is to be:
	-	**Brief:** Keep it dense and use links
	-	**Practical:** Basic facts, concrete details, advice, gotchas, and other “folk knowledge”
	-	**Current:** We can keep updating it, and anyone can contribute improvements
	-	**Thoughtful:** The goal is to be helpful rather than present dry facts. Thoughtful opinion with rationale is welcome. Suggestions, notes, and opinions based on real experience can be extremely valuable. (We believe this is both possible with a guide of this format.)
-	This guide is not sponsored by VMware or VMware-affiliated vendors. It is written by and for engineers who use VMware.
